Dan's Nyxt Homebrew

## Status: Not currently maintained, probably does not work

11/20/2022: I haven't touched this repo for the last year or so. Someday I would like to update it for recent versions of Nyxt and macOS, but for now there is a good chance that this formula will not work for you, and exists mostly as a starting point for someone else to get it working better. If you are that person, I'm happy to answer whatever questions I can.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install incidentist/nyxt/<formula>`

Or `brew tap incidentist/nyxt` and then `brew install <formula>`.

To install Nyxt:
`brew install incidentist/nyxt/webkitgtk`
(This could take over an hour.)

`brew install incidentist/nyxt/nyxt`

Nyxt is installed in the homebrew tree because it is not a cask yet. To run it:

`/usr/local/Cellar/nyxt/2.0.0/bin/Nyxt.app/Contents/MacOS/nyxt`

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
