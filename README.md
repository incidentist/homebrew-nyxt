Dan's Nyxt Homebrew
## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install incidentist/nyxt/<formula>`

Or `brew tap incidentist/nyxt` and then `brew install <formula>`.

To install Nyxt:
`brew install incidentist/nyxt/webkitgtk`
(This could take over an hour.)

`brew install incidentist/nyxt/nyxt`

Nyxt is installed in the homebrew tree because it is not a cask yet. To run it:

`/usr/local/Cellar/nyxt/2.0.0/bin/Nyxt.app/Contents/MacOS/nyxt`
